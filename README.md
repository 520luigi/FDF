# FDF
The simplest FdF I can make solely for the purpose of reading a file, and putting a semi 3d image to the screen. There is a total of 9 functions including the main. 

There are 3 files. One to read the input file, one to print the map onto the screen, and a main file. There are no rotations, no extra elements, and no keyboard or mouse interactions. There is only one struct used which only contained 5 variables. The goal is to make a simple one that I can make and recreated in less than an hours time. 

Run the code by calling makefile. The minilibx library only works on macos, so there are a bunch of limitations of what you can do here. 

Once the makefile is made, an executable fdf is created. 

Use the following code to run the executable with a map file to test it out!

```./fdf maps/[map name]```
